The structure of the course is designed to have a top-down approach. It starts with the theory - all you need to know is to put dbt (Data Build Tool) in context and to have an understanding of how it fits into the modern data stack. We start with the big picture, then we go deeper and deeper. Once you learned about the pieces, we are going to shift to the technicalities - a practical section -, which will focus on putting together the dbt “puzzle”. The practical section will cover each and every single dbt feature present today through the construction of a complete, real-world project; Airbnb. This presents an opportunity for us to show you which features should be used at what stage in a given project, and you will see how dbt is used in the industry.

**THEORETICAL SECTION:**

Among several other topics, the theoretical section puts special emphasis on transferring knowledge in the following areas;

 * Data-Maturity Model
 * Well-functioning Data Architectures
 * Data Warehouses, Data Lakes, and Data Lakehouses
 * ETL and ELT procedures and Data Transformations
 * Fundamentals of dbt (Data Build Tool)
 * Analytics Engineering
 * Normalization
 * Slowly Changing Dimensions
 * CTEs

Once we understood the theoretical layer and how dbt fits into the picture, we are going to start building out a dbt project from scratch, just how you would do this in the real world.

**PRACTICAL SECTION:**

The practical section will go through a real-world Airbnb project where you will master the ins and outs of dbt! We put special focus on getting everyone up and ready before the technical deep dive, hence we will start off by setting up our Development Environment:

 * MAC Development Environment Setup
 * WINDOWS Development Environment Setup
 * IDE dbt Extension Installation
 * Creation and Activation of Virtual Environments
 * Setting up Snowflake
 
Once we are ready - among several other technical topics, the following features will be covered;

 * dbt Models
 * dbt Materializations
 * dbt Tests
 * dbt Documentation
 * dbt Sources, Seeds, Snapshots
 * dbt Hooks and Operations
 * Jinja and Macros
 * Analyses, Exposures 
 * dbt Seeds
 * Data Visualization (Preset)


**Project Overview**

When the Airbnb project is presented to you, you have to do it in its entirety, without omitting any guidelines and by understanding the objective. A project "almost completely" done is often a project "totally incomplete" for us. Give special attention to detail. Your only reliable source of information regarding the instructions is the pedagogical team, don't trust the "I've heard".

By the time you complete the course, you will be equipped with both a very solid theoretical understanding and practical expertise with dbt. All the fundamentals, dbt features, best practices, advanced techniques and more will be covered in our course, which will make you become a master in dbt. Are you ready? ;)
